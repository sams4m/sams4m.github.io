        <h3>
          1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h3>

        <p>
          The first thing that I paid attention to was the fact that the page
          was initially split by the four neon colours. It was a coincidence
          that my mouse had also happened to be at the intersection of the four
          versions of text, which immediately prompted me to move the mouse
          around in attempt to read the various versions of the text where the
          keywords hard interchanged. This initial interaction had also
          encouraged me to hover over all the different elements on screen
          moving forward, setting the fun tone in the interactions for the rest
          of the page.

            <p>
              ❄️ moving the mouse in attempt to read the four versions of text
              on the initial landing screen; realising they the key words
              interchanged each time, one for each colour. Though the pink and
              purple were a bit hard to read, whilst the neon green and blue
              were definitely more readable.

              <!-- break -->
              &nbsp <br />

              ❄️ After the initial interaction on the landing page, it prompted
              me to interact with all the objects on the screen more, curious to
              see what the next interaction may be/will do

              <br />
              <!-- break -->
              &nbsp <br />

              ❄️ immediately hovering over the triangle rotated it around and
              changed the order of the text

              <br />
              <!-- break -->
              &nbsp <br />

              ❄️ moving the mouse with the intention to hover over the pixelised
              image after experiencing the hover interaction with the triangle,
              but quickly realising the pixelised image reacts to the mouse
              location; interacting with the pixelised image made it warp. The
              pixels seemed to repel against the mouse like trying to put two
              same ends of a magnet together. In this sense, it sort of reflects
              the first interaction on the landing screen.

              <br />
              <!-- break -->
              &nbsp <br />

              ❄️ I was anticipating a hover interaction, going by the mouse
              tracking, then hover pattern. I was proved to be correct when
              interacting with the text through hovering, and then seeing the
              text animate as a result.

              <br />
              <!-- break -->
              &nbsp <br />

              It can be concluded all of the expereince relied on some form of
              mouse interaction to achieve.

          <article class="box-col">
            <h3>
              3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time
              engaging with?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I spent the most time on the landing page in attempt to read what
              the texts say under the influence of the different colours. This
              was primarily due to finding the words in the pink and pruple
              difficult to read, so I had to spend more time in order to
              decipher the words. Otherwise, I spent the longest actually
              interacting with the webpage with the pixelised image. I just
              found it mesmerising and addictive to play with. After the initial
              addictive play, I was then interacting out of curoisity to come up
              with ideas as to how it might have been coded to create that
              effect.

          <!-- QUESTION 4 ----------------------------------->
          <span class="box-col">
            <h3>
              4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction
              with the experience?
            </h3>
            <p>
              The most common action was definitely was moving the mouse around
              the screen, sometimes randomly, but othertimes over elements on
              the screen ge to see if and how they react after the initial
              realisation on the landing page. It became some what obvious what
              I should do as I realised a pattern to how the interactions were
              displayed throughout the portfolio website; interchanging between
              mouse tracking and hover based interaction. Though a pattern can
              be identified, each section showed the viewer a different
              possibility of interaction design even though the core action was
              the same/similar.

      <!-- QUESTION 5 --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <article class="box-row">
        <h3>
          5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The impression gathered from the website was to showcase the artist's
          interactive design / capabilities through a portfolio piece to share
          with people in cases of job searching and networking. With that in
          mind, the designer had created a website that is short and sharp,
          showing different areas they're good at, and what possibilities with
          their skills they may bring to the potential clients. This was done
          through making the portfolio a piece of work itself, rather than the
          portfolio being a platform to showcase previous work(s),as a
          traditional portfolio would. The short length kept in mind short
          attention span, and made it engaging enough to convey the key points
          of their skill(s), whilst peaking interest in the viewer to
          potentially want to seek out more information on their work if
          needed/wanted.

      <!-- QUESTION 6 --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <article class="box-row">
        <h3>
          6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The artist communicates the primary goal through turning the
          non-traditional conceptualisation of their portfolio, through
          converting the portfolio itself into a piece of work, rather than
          utlising the portfolio as a platform to share and showcase their
          previous works. This gives the viewer a more intimate experience to
          their abilities rather than having seperate things to interact with.
          Though both approaches have their pros and cons. Had this portfolio
          been multi-paged, it may have been a point of interest to have a
          secondary page that worked functionally as a conventional portfolio,
          showcasing further works for those that were interested after
          experiencing what this portfolio page had to offer. Overall, this
          approach makes for an effective and concise experience to achieve the
          primary goal.

      <!-- QUESTION 7 --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <article class="box-row">
        <h3>
          7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h3>
        <p>
          The impression is that this portfolio is designed to be a quick and
          easy interaction experience; to convey the full potential of the
          artist's skills set in the shortest amount of time needed to
          experience. I found this rather intelligent, as it takes into account
          the fact that when applying for jobs, the hiring party would most
          likely be looking through many portfolios. This portfolio approach
          condenses the time required for the hiring team to understand the
          artist when interacting with the portfolio. And on the long run, it
          may invite them to reach out to the artist, or seek out further
          information and/or work by the artist.

      <!-- QUESTION 8 --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <article class="box-row">
        <h3>
          8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Through spanning the experience over a short length, showcasing
          specific and different interactions, it leads the user in how to
          interact with the content. Particularly, choosing to start with the
          four quads that change text and colour depending on where your mouse
          is on the screen, it sets the tone of the experience. Telling the
          viewer that this is a webpage that will focus on mouse interaction in
          correlation to the content, even if the user doesn't read the
          introductory text which explains that they are a frontend and web
          designer. But most of all, the use of bright bold maximalist colours
          which changes upon mouse movement prompts the user's curiosity.
          Whether that is in the form of playing around with the webpage more or
          to look further into the artist's other socials to see what else they
          have done apart from the webpage. As a hirer it may prompt the webpage
          to be shared with others given its simple and concise nature. In a
          networking context, it may be a conversational prompt, prompting more
          interest in the artist's other works.

            <h3>
              9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the
              experience reference?
            </h3>

            <p>
              It's clear to the eye that the work takes root from Graphic Design
              concepts. This can be seen from the get go with the bold landing
              page utilising tetradic colours (otherwise known as double
              complementary), this makes it particularly attention grabing,
              pulling the user's eyesight in at a glance. Making it hard to
              dismiss. Tetradic colours produces a a feeling of contrast and
              energy, making for a complex and rich visual experience, which is
              ideal for attractive designs. Alongside colour theory, Tuntaopas
              uses a combination of interaction and shapes to create optical
              illusions which make up the imagery on their portfolio. This is
              evident in the 'perfectly center[ed]' triangle and 'pixel
              displacement effect' landscape image. This helps create an
              engaging platform for users to experience.

        <p>
          The references communicated through this portfolio provides an example
          to how skills and techniques from different practices may cross over.
          Emphasising the importance of having an open mind to broadening your
          scope in terms of learning, and it's not a negative thing to learn and
          apply ideas outside of the specified area of design. Skills,
          techniques and ideas are very much interchangable no matter what field
          of study you may be studying full time in, or researching out of
          interest, and embracing this open mindedness may be the key to
          creating something unique to you as a practitioner.

        <p>
          The references made in this portfolio promotes the importance of
          curiosity as a designer as much as open mindedness. Feeling curious as
          a designer to reach out to other venues and practices will only
          provoke further intellectual thinking, improving one's own creative
          practices. Without curiosity, the artist will never have the urge to
          try things, learn and expand outside of their comfort zone, limits and
          current circle of knowledge and skill set. Combining keeping an open
          mind and curiosity will only push an artist's work to improve and
          create opportunities for them to reach their creative potentials.

            <p>
              The primary and largest frustration of interacting with this
              portfolio would definitely be the colour choices for the pink and
              purple squares on the landing page. The chosen contrasting colour
              for the highlighted keyword in those squares don't provide a great
              contrast level and made reading accessibility for the user very
              low. When interacting with this portion, it had taken moments
              longer to read what those squares had highlighted, unlike the
              green and blue squares above which had high readability, and were
              readable at a glance. Requiring little to no effort to read. Apart
              from this initial frustration, the other interactions in this
              portfolio were really fun, and any other areas that required
              readable text as the primary engagement enforced a high level of
              readability.

        <p>
          The most satisfying moment in this experience was realising everything
          interacted upon mouse location/mouse tracking. It made the website
          very enjoyable to explore despite being quite short in comparison to
          the other portfolio websites available for this assignment. I found
          the text button interaction at the end of the page particularly
          enjoyable to interact with. The way the text would spin and move
          around, and exchange and transform letters made it fun to hover over,
          whilst efficiently showcasing skill capability. I found that
          particularly smart on top of the experience as a front end web
          developer's portfolio. It was also an exciting interaction to see,
          showcasing the possibilities of creative coding, and made me curious
