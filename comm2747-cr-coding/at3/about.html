          This project is to create a response to
          <a src="https://lauren-mccarthy.com/I-heard-TALKING-IS-DANGEROUS"
            >Lauren Lee McCarthy's</a
          >
          project "I heard talking is dangerous". Lauren, through this project,
          reached out to and engaged with their community of friends during the
          time of lockdown, covid 19 with the help of technology. Through
          delivering a monologue, they start a conversion that is held via a
          text-to-speech functionality to discuss the then controversial topic
          of masks and social distancing.
          <br />
          Lauren used technology to connect with others in her community to
          prompt an interesting conversation, the aim of this project is to, in
          a similar fashion, engage with a chosen community of mine through
          creative coding.
          <br />
          The chosen community is the creative friends around me. I have asked
          those around me that I know to be creatively inclined to share a piece
          of their creative selves with the aim to create one big collaborative
          portfolio that I can then share back with everyone.
          <br />
          The portfolio is reflective of the creative network that stems from
          myself and I hope sharing the portfolio back with everyone that
          they'll find something new and inspiring from the others in my network
          to help their creative practice. Fostering an interconnected creative
          network; mycelial creativity.

          Breaking down 'creative friends' as a community of practice:
        </h3>
        <h4>Domain:</h4>
        <p class="abouttxt">
          Creative friends, and groups in general, are often constantly
          exploring new ideas, mediums, cultures and possibilities. Many start
          within one specific area of creative work but I think many end up
          expanding; learning new techniques and mediums to improve and develop
          their own practice. This can often look like finding ways to use
          things unconventionally (like using a 3d modelling application like
          blender to create node interactions) or using creative techniques in
          tandem with other areas to innovate (like creative start ups or
          marketing).
        </p>
        <h4>Repertoire:</h4>
        <p class="abouttxt">
          This community are often big in creative thinking; brainstorming and
          ideation, storytelling and narrative structure, and a keen eye on
          minute details and aesthetics. But also hold high technical skill
          literacy; creative tools (Adobe suite), traditional
          techniques(sketching, model sculpting (physical and digital), writing
          and musical instruments), and high digital fluency (social media
          content). With the cross-disciplinary nature of the creative community
          and industry, this community is also very collaborative with an open
          minded-ness to experimentation and failure.
          <br />
          I find that a common lived experience between the creative friends
          around me often include a Macbook of some sort with an extensive file
          system that often isn't organised very well, but makes sense to
          themselves, which is where the inspiration for the interface and
          aesthetics of this portfolio has come from.
        </p>

        <h4>Values:</h4>
        <p class="abouttxt">
          The values that often drive the interactions of the creative community
          as a whole, and the creative friends I have around me are often held
          in high authenticity with a constant curiosity to learn from our lived
          experiences to improve our practice and learn from each other.
          Interacting with one another theres often a playfulness that sparks
          the creation of work that resonates emotionally with ourselves and
          others. I've found that this group also hold a higher regard for
          sustainability as a whole too, therefore I'd say the creative friends
          around me are very empathetic.
