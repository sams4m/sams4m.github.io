        <h3>
          1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h3>

        <p>
          The first thing that I paid attention to was the fact that the page
          was initially split by the four neon colours. It was a coincidence
          that my mouse had also happened to be at the intersection of the four
          versions of text, which prompted me to move the mouse around to read
          the two versions of the text where keywords were interchanged.

              2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each
              of your discrete actions.
            </h3>
            <p>
              ‚ùÑÔ∏è moving the mouse to try read the four versions of text on the
              initial landing screen; realising they just have key words
              interchanged, one for each colour. Though the neon green and blue
              were definitely more readable.
              <br />
              ‚ùÑÔ∏è After the interaction on the landing page, it prompted me to
              interact with the objects on the screen more
              <br />
              ‚ùÑÔ∏è interacting with the triangle flipped it around and changed the
              order of the text
              <br />
              ‚ùÑÔ∏è interacting with the pixelised image made it warp; the pixels
              repelled against the mouse like putting two same ends of a magnet
              together.
              <br />
              ‚ùÑÔ∏è interacting with the text when you hover over them
              <br />
              <br />
              It can be concluded a lot of the interaction relies on mouse
              tracking to achieve.

              I spent the most time on the landing page in attempt to read what
              the texts say under the influence of the different colours.

              Hovering over all the elements on the page to see if and how they
              react after the initial realisation on the landing page. Each
              section showed the viewer a different kind of interaction design.

          5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The impression gathered from the website was to showcase the artist's
          interactive design / capabilities as a portfolio piece to share with
          people in cases of job searching and networking.

        <h3>
          6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The artist communicates the primary goal by turning the portfolio
          itself into a piece of work, rather than adding work to showcase. This
          gives the viewer a more intimate experience to their abilities rather
          than having seperate things to interact with. It makes it effective
          and concise.

          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)

        <p>
          The impression is that it is designed to be a quick and easy
          interaction experience; to convey the full potential artist's skills
          set in the shortest amount of time. This takes into account the fact
          that when applying for jobs, the hiring party would most likely be
          looking through many portfolios. Condensing the time required to
          interact with the portfolio would allow for the hiring team to to pay
          more attention to more than just a mere glance. It may invite them to
          interact with the webpage for longer than required.

          8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h3>
        <p>
          It prompts the user's curiosity. Whether that is in the form of
          playing around with the webpage more or to look further into the
          artist's other socials to see what else they have done apart from the
          webpage. As a hirer it may prompt the webpage to be shared with others
          given its simple and concise nature. In a networking context, it may
          be a conversational prompt, prompting more interest in the artist's
          other works.

              9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the
              experience reference?
            </h3>

            <p>
              The work takes root from Graphic Design concepts. Particularly
              with the dramatic landing page utilising tetradic colours, this
              makes it particularly attention grabing, pulling the user in at a
              glance. Making it hard to dismiss. Alongside colour theory,
              Tuntaopas uses a combination of interaction and shapes to create
              optical illusions which make up the imagery on their portfolio.
              This is evident in the 'perfectly center[ed]' triangle and 'pixel
              displacement effect' landscape image.

            <p>
              This provides an example to how skills and techniques from
              different practices may cross over, and emphasises the importance
              of having an open mind to broadening your scope in terms of
              learning, and it's not a negative thing to learn things outside of
              design. Those skills, techniques and ideas may one day cross over
              to your work and create something unique.

        </h3>
        <p>
          This promotes the importance of curiosity as a designer as much as
          open mindedness. Feeling curious as a designer to reach out to other
          venues and practices will only provoke further intellectual thinking,
          improving one's own practices when it comes to creating work.
          Combining keeping an open mind and curiosity will only push ones' work
          to improve and create opportunities for them to reach their creative
          potentials.

            <p>
              The primary frustration of the interaction would be the colour
              choices for the pink and purple squares on the landing page. The
              chosen contrasting colour for the highlighted keyword in those
              squares doesn't provide a great contrast level and made
              readability low. It had taken a moment longer to read what those
              squares had highlighted, unlike the green and blue squares which
              were readable at a glance. Otherwise, the other interactions were
              really fun, and readability was high.

        <p>
          The most satisfying moment was realising everything interacted upon
          mouse location/mouse tracking. It made the website very enjoyable to
          explore despite being quite short in comparison to the other portfolio
          websites available. I found the text button interaction at the end of
          the page particularly enjoyable to interact with. The way the text
          would spin and move around, and exchange and transform letters made it
          fun to hover over, whilst efficiently showcasing skill capability. I
          found that particularly smart on top of the experience as a front end
          web developer's portfolio.
