      <!-- QUESTION 1--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <span>
        <h2>
          1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first thing that I paid attention to was the fact that the page
          was initially split by the four neon colours. It was a coincidence
          that my mouse had also happened to be at the intersection of the four
          versions of text, which prompted me to move the mouse around to read
          the two versions of the text where keywords were interchanged.
        </p>

            <!-- QUESTION 2 --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
            <h2>
              2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each
              of your discrete actions.
            </h2>
            <p>
              ‚ùÑÔ∏è moving the mouse to try read the four versions of text on the
              initial landing screen; realising they just have key words
              interchanged, one for each colour. Though the neon green and blue
              were definitely more readable.
              <br />
              ‚ùÑÔ∏è After the interaction on the landing page, it prompted me to
              interact with the objects on the screen more
              <br />
              ‚ùÑÔ∏è interacting with the triangle flipped it around and changed the
              order of the text
              <br />
              ‚ùÑÔ∏è interacting with the pixelised image made it warp; the pixels
              repelled against the mouse like putting two same ends of a magnet
              together.
              <br />
              ‚ùÑÔ∏è interacting with the text when you hover over them
              <br />
              <br />
              It can be concluded a lot of the interaction relies on mouse
              tracking to achieve.

            <h2>
              3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time
              engaging with?
            </h2>
            <p>
              I spent the most time on the landing page in attempt to read what
              the texts say under the influence of the different colours.
            </p>
          </span>

          <!-- QUESTION 4 --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
          <span>
            <h2>
              4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction
              with the experience?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Hovering over all the elements on the page to see if and how they
              react after the initial realisation on the landing page. Each
              section showed the viewer a different kind of interaction design.

      <!-- QUESTION 5 --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <span>
        <h2>
          5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The impression gathered from the website was to showcase the artist's
          interactive design / capabilities as a portfolio piece to share with
          people in cases of job searching and networking.
        </p>
      </span>

      <!-- QUESTION 6 --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <span>
        <h2>
          6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The artist communicates the primary goal by turning the portfolio
          itself into a piece of work, rather than adding work to showcase. This
          gives the viewer a more intimate experience to their abilities rather
          than having seperate things to interact with. It makes it effective
          and concise.
        </p>
      </span>

      <!-- QUESTION 7 --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <span>
        <h2>
          7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h2>
        <p>
          The impression is that it is designed to be a quick and easy
          interaction experience; to convey the full potential artist's skills
          set in the shortest amount of time. This takes into account the fact
          that when applying for jobs, the hiring party would most likely be
          looking through many portfolios. Condensing the time required to
          interact with the portfolio would allow for the hiring team to to pay
          more attention to more than just a mere glance. It may invite them to
          interact with the webpage for longer than required.
        </p>
      </span>

      <!-- QUESTION 8 --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <span>
        <h2>
          8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It prompts the user's curiosity. Whether that is in the form of
          playing around with the webpage more or to look further into the
          artist's other socials to see what else they have done apart from the
          webpage. As a hirer it may prompt the webpage to be shared with others
          given its simple and concise nature. In a networking context, it may
          be a conversational prompt, prompting more interest in the artist's
          other works.
        </p>
      </span>

      <!-- QUESTION 9 --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <span>
        <h2>
          9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h2>

        <p>
          The work takes root from Graphic Design concepts. Particularly with
          the dramatic landing page utilising tetradic colours, this makes it
          particularly attention grabing, pulling the user in at a glance.
          Making it hard to dismiss. Alongside colour theory, Tuntaopas uses a
          combination of interaction and shapes to create optical illusions
          which make up the imagery on their portfolio. This is evident in the
          'perfectly center[ed]' triangle and 'pixel displacement effect'
          landscape image.
